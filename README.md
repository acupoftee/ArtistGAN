# artistGAN
DCGAN focused on generative art--landscapes, nude-portraits, and others. All artwork used during training was scraped from [Wiki Art](https://www.wikiart.org/) using `wikiart_spider.py`. 

## Examples
### LandscapeGAN

### AbstractGAN

### FlowerGAN

## Coming Soon
While I've learned and applied new training techniques, I'm modifying the gan to produce larger results. Now that I have some good models to work with I'll also test a trained model with a different genre (i.e. apply an abstract gan with flowers, landscapes, etc)
